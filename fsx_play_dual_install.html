    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>These instructions are used to install a parallel version of FSX Play to test different builds as needed while preserving (and sharing) the entire course catalogue</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>To install Beta version alongside PROD:</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>Move &quot;Catalogue&quot; folder from &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\FSX Play\FSX Play_Data\StreamingAssets&quot; to &quot;C:\temp&quot; (create C:\temp if it doesn't exist)</p>
    
    <p>Copy &quot;FSX Play&quot; folder in &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)&quot; folder and paste back into &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Rename &quot;FSX Play - Copy&quot; to &quot;FSX Play - PROD&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Install the Beta version - uncheck &quot;Create a desktop shortcut&quot; on the &quot;Select Additional Tasks&quot; screen (last screen before &quot;Install&quot;)</p>
    
    <p>Run &quot;Command Prompt&quot; as administrator and then run the following commands after &quot;CMD: &quot;</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>CMD: CD &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\FSX Play\FSX Play_Data\StreamingAssets&quot;</li>
        <li>CMD: mklink /D Catalogue C:\temp\Catalogue CMD: CD &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\FSX Play - PROD\FSX Play_Data\StreamingAssets&quot;</li>
        <li>CMD: mklink /D Catalogue C:\temp\Catalogue</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In File Explorer, go into the &quot;FSX Play - PROD&quot; folder, right click on &quot;FSX Play.exe&quot; and &quot;Send To -> Desktop&quot; to create a shortcut.</p>
    
    <p>On the desktop, rename the &quot;FSX Play.exe - Shortcut&quot; shortcut to &quot;FSX Play PROD&quot;</p>
    
    <p>On the desktop, rename the &quot;FSX Play&quot; icon to &quot;FSX Play RC&quot;, then right-click on it, click Properties and under the Compatibility tab, check the &quot;Run this program as an Administrator&quot; box and click &quot;OK&quot;</p>
    
    <hr />
    <h3>To Update BETA to an updated BETA version:</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Install the newer Beta version - uncheck &quot;Create a desktop shortcut&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Run the new Beta version from its labeled desktop shortcut</p>
    
    <hr />
    <h3>To Update PROD to new version:</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Install the new PROD version as normal</p>
    
    <p>Run the new PROD version once and exit out</p>
    
    <p>Delete old &quot;FSX Play - PROD&quot; folder in &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)&quot; that is now outdated - OPTIONAL - If you want to keep it, just rename it from &quot;FSX Play - PROD&quot; to &quot;FSX Play - x_x_x_x&quot; (where x_x_x_x is the old version - ex: 1_10_0_10) - Create a desktop shortcut for it if you want to run it later</p>
    
    <p>Copy &quot;FSX Play&quot; folder in &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)&quot; folder and paste back into &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Rename &quot;FSX Play - Copy&quot; to &quot;FSX Play - PROD&quot;</p>
    
    <p>In File Explorer, go into the new &quot;FSX Play - PROD&quot; folder, right click on &quot;FSX Play.exe&quot; and &quot;Send To -> Desktop&quot; to create a shortcut.</p>
    
    <p>On the desktop, rename each shortcut to label the version (example: &quot;1.11.0.17 PROD&quot; or &quot;1.11.0.16 RC&quot; so you can see the complete data, too long will be truncated visually...)</p>
    
    <p>OPTIONAL - If you want to keep using a Beta version, just re-install the same Beta version you were using under the steps in &quot;To Update BETA to an updated BETA version&quot;</p>

    <h3>NOTES:</h3>
    <hr />
    
    <ul>
    <li>You can always see which version of FSX Play you are running by clicking on the Foresights Sports logo at the top of the Main Menu</li>
    <li>If you start play without using the desktop shortcuts (like from the start menu), you will load the RC version</li>
    <li>Beta is updated frequently, so a new build can be installed as use the existing desktop shortcut</li>
    <li>Prod will be the &quot;side&quot; installed version so it will be out of harms way when Beta is updated - Run which ever you want.
        <ul>
            <li>Warning: Since the share the same data in the %appdata% folder, you might need to double check your settings [or accept T&amp;C each time] if you bounce back and forth frequently</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Both installs will now point to the same course catalogue, so you can install/update courses as normal from either
        <ul>
            <li>Note: If the Download Manager has errors with courses in the Prod version, manage the course(s) in the Beta version (since the Beta version is using the expected installed file location &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\FSX Play&quot;)</li></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

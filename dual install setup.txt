-------------------------------------------
To install Beta version alongside PROD:
-------------------------------------------

Move "Catalogue" folder from "C:\Program Files (x86)\FSX Play\FSX Play_Data\StreamingAssets" to "C:\temp" (create C:\temp if it doesn't exist)

Copy "FSX Play" folder in "C:\Program Files (x86)" folder and paste back into "C:\Program Files (x86)"

Rename "FSX Play - Copy" to "FSX Play - PROD"

Install the Beta version - uncheck "Create a desktop shortcut" on the "Select Additional Tasks" screen (last screen before "Install")

Run "Command Prompt" as administrator and then run the following commands after "CMD: "

CMD: CD "C:\Program Files (x86)\FSX Play\FSX Play_Data\StreamingAssets"
CMD: mklink /D Catalogue C:\temp\Catalogue
CMD: CD "C:\Program Files (x86)\FSX Play - PROD\FSX Play_Data\StreamingAssets"
CMD: mklink /D Catalogue C:\temp\Catalogue

In File Explorer, go into the "FSX Play - PROD" folder, right click on "FSX Play.exe" and "Send To -> Desktop" to create a shortcut.

On the desktop, rename the "FSX Play.exe - Shortcut" shortcut to "FSX Play PROD"

On the desktop, rename the "FSX Play" icon to "FSX Play RC", then right-click on it, click Properties and under the Compatibility tab, check the "Run this program as an Administrator" box and click "OK"

-------------------------------------------
To Update BETA to an updated BETA version:
-------------------------------------------

Install the newer Beta version - uncheck "Create a desktop shortcut"

Run the new Beta version from its labeled desktop shortcut

-------------------------------------------
To Update PROD to new version:
-------------------------------------------

Install the new PROD version as normal

Run the new PROD version once and exit out

Delete old "FSX Play - PROD" folder in "C:\Program Files (x86)" that is now outdated - OPTIONAL - If you want to keep it, just rename it from "FSX Play - PROD" to "FSX Play - x_x_x_x" (where x_x_x_x is the old version - ex: 1_10_0_10) - Create a desktop shortcut for it if you want to run it later

Copy "FSX Play" folder in "C:\Program Files (x86)" folder and paste back into "C:\Program Files (x86)"

Rename "FSX Play - Copy" to "FSX Play - PROD"

In File Explorer, go into the new "FSX Play - PROD" folder, right click on "FSX Play.exe" and "Send To -> Desktop" to create a shortcut.

On the desktop, rename each shortcut to label the version (example: "1.11.0.17 PROD" or "1.11.0.16 RC" so you can see the complete data, too long will be truncated visually...)

OPTIONAL - If you want to keep using a Beta version, just re-install the same Beta version you were using under the steps in "To Update BETA to an updated BETA version"

-------------------------------------------
NOTES
-------------------------------------------

You can always see which version of FSX Play you are running by clicking on the Foresights Sports logo at the top of the Main Menu

If you start play without using the shortcuts on the desktop (like from start menu) you will load the RC version...

Beta is updated frequently, so a new build can be installed easily and you only have to update the shortcut link (if you put the version in there)

Prod will be the "side" installed version so it will be out of harms way when Beta is updated - Run which ever you want. (Warning: Since the share the same data in the %appdata% folder, you might need to double check your settings [or accept T&C each time] if you bounce back and forth frequently)

Both will now point to the same course catalogue, so you can install/update courses as normal (if the Download Manager has errors with courses in the Prod version, manage the course in the Beta version [since the Beta version is "sitting" in the normally installed file location])
